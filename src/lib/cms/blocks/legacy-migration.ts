 * actually tested, not a script that's only ever "tested" by running it
 * against production data.
 *
 * None of these invent content: every legacy field becomes exactly one
 * Markdown block (the closest block type to "an existing markdown string"),
 * optionally preceded by a Heading block when a collection's legacy shape
 * had more than one named field (Case Study's problem/approach/result,
 * Blueprint's description + customization notes) — purely so a reader of
 * the migrated document can still tell the sections apart, never a
 * restriction on how the author edits it going forward.
