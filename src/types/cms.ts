 *
 * `"json"` is the one addition Phase D makes to this vocabulary (§14 Phase
 * E's collection rollout): `TeamMember.skills`/`socials`/`experience`/
 * `education` (`ARCHITECTURE/11_DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §1) are nested
 * arrays/objects with no flat-field equivalent, the same wall `CaseStudy`'s
 * `quote` hit and was deferred past rather than solved (`models/case-study.ts`).
 * Rather than build a full nested-repeater form builder for a shape only one
 * field family needs so far, this is a raw-JSON textarea, validated by the
 * collection's own Zod schema on submit — a deliberate, minimal escape
 * hatch, not a placeholder awaiting a future upgrade. A future collection
 * with the same "structured, variable-shape data" need reuses this instead
 * of prompting a fourth new field type.
 *
 * `"reference"`/`"referenceArray"` render a real searchable picker
 * (`<ReferencePicker>`/`<ReferencePickerList>`, `reference-picker.tsx`) — the
 * field only declares `resource` (which collection to search) and
 * `labelField` (which of that collection's own fields is the human-readable
 * label); `lib/cms/reference-search.ts` resolves both generically through
 * the `collection-config.ts` registry, so no collection-specific code exists
 * anywhere in the picker.
